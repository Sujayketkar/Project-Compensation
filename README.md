# Project-Compensation

Managing compensation is a complex endeavor that covers multiple facets including salaries, wages, bonuses, benefits, and additional incentives given to employees for their work. It involves navigating a delicate balance between budget constraints and providing fair rewards to employees.

In the practical scenario of our dummy data project, we address similar elements. This entails a fictional organization- Cityla, handling compensation management across various outlined factors. I've utilized Pandas to analyse data.
